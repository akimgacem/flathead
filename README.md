Flathead
========

Flathead is a minimal JavaScript (ECMA 5.1) implementation written in C.
It's comes with:

* A lexer generated by Flex
* A parser generated by Bison
* An interpreter that walks the AST
* The standard library plus a console
* A JavaScript integration test suite and runner

It's still very new, and lots of things are missing.
